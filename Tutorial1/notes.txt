Structure
<!DOCTYPE html> this informs the computer what kind of file it is and how to read it.

<html> Is all the code that is to be read.

<head> Is metadata about the page. This information will dictate how the page acts but not what
actually appears on the page. An example of this would be <title> which will appear as the title
of the page in the web tab but not appear on the actual page.

<body> All the content that is displayed on the page is put into the body. This includes all text,
images, form items etc.

HTML Elements and Attributes

Elements
Elements are just names that components are given.
For example, <h1> means heading one. This makes the text larger and bold because it is a heading.
The braces <> create an opening brace and </> is a closing brace for that element.
<p> is for paragraph. This is for normal text.

Attributes
Elements can also be given attributes to change their behaviour.
As an example, <textarea> will create a box on the page that can be typed into.
Now an attribute can be added ot the text area by putting them into the element tag.
For example, <textarea rows = "40"> will create a text box that is 40 lines long
rather than the default 3 lines before needing to scroll.

Unordered List
Another type of element is the Unordered List <ul>.
This will make a bullet point list full of List Items <li>.
These will be listed in the order they are written and each <li> will have its own dot point.

Ordered List
There is also an Ordered List <ol>.
This is essentially the same as a <ul> except that each point is now numbered
rather than being a dot point.

Anchor
The Anchor Tag <a>, when used in conjunction with the attribute "href" is used as a method for
embedding links into a page. As an example:
<a href = "http://google.com">Click here to find cat memes!</a>
Will display the text: "Click here to find cat memes!"
as a hyper link that will take the user to the site defined in the href attribute.

Divs and Spans

Divs and Spans are ways to group information or manipulate their appearence.
A Div is particularly useful when trying to style an entire paragraph. Furthermore,
when 2 seperate Divs are next to one another, each will be given a new line.
A Span on the other hand, is more useful when trying to style individual words on the same line.
Two sperate spans next to one another will be displayed side-by-side rather than given
different lines.
The Styling for Divs and Spans can be applied through attributes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Form Elements
These types of elements are used by the end user to convey information into the site.
One such example was the <textarea> that was mentioned above, although there are many others.
Some such examples include <button> which creates a button on the page that can be clicked and
<select> which can be filled with <option>'s to create a drop down selection box.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Images
An image can be added using and <img> tag. each image needs a source or else it will not display.
These images can be drawn from the internet using its hyperlink. The hyper link is added to the
<img> element as an attribute. This looks like:
<img src = "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlNfpdtXcAARCgy?format=jpg&name=900x900" />
As seen above, this element does not need a second set of braces to close.
