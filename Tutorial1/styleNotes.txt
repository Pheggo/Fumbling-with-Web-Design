Style Notes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selectors

There are three types of selectors used to apply styles to things.
They are:
Element selectors
Class selectors
ID selectors


Element Selectors,
are used to apply the same style to all elements that are defined.
As an example:
p{
    color: red;
}
Will turn all paragraph elements on the page to the red colour.
This works with any type of element.


Class Selectors,
create a group with a uniform style that can then be applied to other elements.
This means that if you want certain paragraphs or lists to look a certain way, a class can be
created and then applied to those individual elements as needed.
For example,
HTML
class = "about-list-item"
CSS
.about-list-item{
    font-style: italic;
}


ID Selectors,
are used to style things that are generally a one off occurence. It acts in a similar way to class
selectors although on a smaller scale. Something specific on the page can be given an ID and this ID
will have the style applied to it rather than creating a new class.
For example,
HTML
id = "my-name"
is an attribute applied a heading that states the User's name.
CSS
#my-name{
    color: blue;
}

Note that when reffering to a class in CSS, a "." is used and when reffering to an ID, "#" is used.

Grids

Grids can be applied using CSS to better structure the information on the page.
One of the easiest ways to do this is the following:
CSS
.grid-table {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: auto auto;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
}
The code shown above will create a grid that is 3 sections long and 2 sections tall.
As the size has been defined as "auto" they will automatically size to be even depending on the screen.

However, if the site is opened on mobile, it may not be an ideal layout 
as the screens are tall not wide...

To fix this issue, other code can come into effect when triggered by a certain event.
For example,
CSS
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .grid-table{
        grid-template-rows: auto auto auto auto auto auto;
        grid-template-columns: auto;
    }
}

This alters the above class from a grid of 3x2 (making 6 boxes) into 1x6 and it will only
trigger once the browser size shrinks below a max width of 600 pixels.
